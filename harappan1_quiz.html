                explanation: "The Harappan Civilization flourished from approximately 2600-1900 BCE, making it contemporary with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This period is divided into Early, Mature, and Late Harappan phases."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Indus River system was the lifeline of the Harappan Civilization. The civilization is also known as the Indus Valley Civilization because most of its major cities were located along the Indus River and its tributaries."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are the two largest and most important cities discovered from the Harappan Civilization. Harappa was discovered first (giving the civilization its name), while Mohenjo-daro means 'Mound of the Dead' in Sindhi."

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Despite numerous attempts by scholars worldwide, the Harappan script remains undeciphered. The script contains about 400-600 distinct signs and appears on seals, pottery, and other artifacts, but no Rosetta Stone equivalent has been found."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Steatite (soapstone) was the primary material used for making Harappan seals. These seals typically featured animals like bulls, elephants, and rhinoceros, along with undeciphered script, and were likely used for trade and administrative purposes."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The sophisticated underground drainage and sewerage system was the most remarkable feature of Harappan cities. Every house was connected to the main drainage system, with covered drains running along the streets - a level of urban planning not seen elsewhere until much later."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Great Bath is located in Mohenjo-daro and is one of the most famous structures of the Harappan Civilization. This large, well-built tank was likely used for religious or ceremonial purposes and demonstrates advanced knowledge of hydraulic engineering."
